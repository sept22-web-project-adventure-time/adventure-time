# Adventure Time

## What is Adventure Time?
Given that Portland is rated the top city in the U.S. to eat in, it can be overwhelming to actually choose a spot to eat. Along the same lines, with so many fun activities at your disposal, it can feel impossible to plan a day. So, we created an app in which we handle the plan and you handle the fun. But first, coffee. With the click of a button, Adventure Time serves you a full day of fun, from coffee to activity to dinner.
